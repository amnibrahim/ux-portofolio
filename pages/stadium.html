			<p class="heading">Problem</p>
			<p class="subtext">Stadium is a marketplace for futsal venues based in Yogyakarta. College students were the main target for them. Therefore, Stadium had a marketing strategy to spread the broadcasted message through social media by linking its official website. In the website, there was a list of sport venues available to be booked. The problem was that, Stadium wanted to make the page to be mobile-friendly although displaying multiple venues which resulting in taking more space. The second problem is that Stadium also wanted to develop an admin page that could monitor status of each booked venues. <br><br>The goal was to build a mobile responsive page that could display multiple sports venues without taking too much space and build an admin page to monitor the activity of the transaction.</p>
			<p class="heading">Role</p>
			<p class="subtext">Wireframes and Prototype</p>
			<p class="heading">Process</p>
			<p class="subtext">Sketches - During the discussion with the Stadium team member, it was decided that the venue listing page would be cards-alike element. The inspiration was taken from Pinterest and Behance which could display multiple objects in either desktop or mobile screen.</p>
			<div class="imageText">
				<img src="../img/content/stadium/stadium_ex2.jpg">
			</div>
			<p class="subtext">The main point of this cards element was to make the main image looked bigger so that it could attract user. There were additional information in each card such as the name of the venue, description and open hour.</p>
			<div class="imageText">
				<img src="../img/content/stadium/futsal_venues.png">
			</div>
			<p class="subtext">Initially, the cards were designed to be as wide as 100% of the page as an experiment. However this would take a lot of space and user needed to scroll deep down. The team believed that there was a high chance that only few venues on top of the page would likely be seen while the bottom cards would be ignored. Therefore, the model with three vertical and parallel cards was chosen.</p>
			<div class="imageText">
				<img src="../img/content/stadium/mobile.jpg">
			</div>
			<p class="subtext">The other problem that the team wanted to solve was to build admin page. The team has decided that there were three main info in the admin’s page such as: list of booking, list of venue, and preview.</p>
			<div class="imageText">
				<img src="../img/content/stadium/venues_dashboard.png">
			</div>
			<p class="subtext">Each of the three tabs had similar style of table. Under the table there was a set of input that could enable admin to change particular information such as booking status, update time and update price.</p>
			<div class="imageText">
				<img src="../img/content/stadium/dashboard_form.png">
			</div>
			<p class="subtext">This particular feature were always displayed regardless the admin view different tab. The purpose is to keep the admin comfortable reading any information on each tab while inputting certain info on input forms.</p>
			<p class="heading">Tools</p>
			<p class="subtext">HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Prototype)</p>
			<p class="heading">Outcome</p>
			<p class="subtext">The venue listing page has helped Stadium to reach the potential customer by enabling them to view available sport venues as a marketing strategy. The admin page made the admin work easier by monitoring transaction activities. After serving people by delivering information about sport venues and booking service for almost a year, Stadium has closed its service on April 2018.</p>
