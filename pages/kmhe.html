			<p class="heading">Problem</p>
			<p class="subtext">KMHE (Kompetisi Mobil Hemat Energi) is an annual competition held by Ministry of Education. Every year, there are many participants come from different universities. The committee wants to build a web based platform to deliver any information related to information and required documents for participants to be submitted in a single page. The first problem is that the client wanted to put the timeline of important dates and documents in a single page. The second problem is to build a dashboard that enabled participants to upload different documents. <br><br>The goal was to build a web page that had both timeline and list of download buttons and develop a dashboard that enabled user to upload multiple documents according to dates in a single page</p>
			<p class="heading">Role</p>
			<p class="subtext">Front end developer - built a static prototype for the client to be evaluated and deliver the prototype to back end developer</p>
			<p class="heading">Process</p>
			<p class="subtext">First, the client and the developer team conducted a meeting to discuss about the main feature in the page. It was concluded that some main important features are timeline of important dates and download section for important documents. Furthermore, as there were many participants in the competition, the user experience is expected to be made as simple as possible to prevent any confusion.</p>
			<p class="subtext">Wireframes - The graphic designer built a wireframe based on the problem. The timeline feature was be developed using an external library as the client suggested that it was going to be a simple horizontal timeline. The second design was about dashboard which consisted of several tabs for specific group of documents. Each tab could be clicked and accessed only on specified date according to timeline.</p>
			<div class="imageText">

			</div>
			<p class="subtext">The client suggested that there would be more than four documents. Therefore, the download section will be placed in the bottom of the page while the timeline will be placed on top of the download section. The purpose was to highlight the timeline and make visitor pay more attention to the timeline first before going to download section.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="subtext">The second wireframe in this particular problem is the dashboard. In this case, the dashboard contained four horizontal tabs where each tab consisted of row of uploaded document. The name of the document is located in the most left then followed by upload button and status on the most right. This decision was made as the visitor would normally to read from top to bottom and left to right.</p>
			<p class="heading">Prototype</p>
			<p class="subtext">After conducting iterative process of prototyping and evaluation, the design has been completed. There were 10 documents that can be downloaded using download button.</p>
			<div class="imageText">
				<img src="../img/content/kmhe/flow.jpg">
			</div>
			<p class="subtext">The timeline was made using horizontal line and bullets and could be clicked to both right and left direction in order to save space and keep the design be simple.</p>
			<div class="imageText">
				<img src="../img/content/kmhe/dashboard.jpg">
			</div>
			<p class="subtext">On the other hand, there was no significant change in the dashboard. The dashboard section and team name was placed on top left as a starting point for user flows to visualize the page which ended in bottom right.</p>
			<p class="heading">Tools</p>
			<p class="subtext">Figma (Wireframes), HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Bootstrap (Prototype)</p>
			<p class="heading">Outcome</p>
			<p class="subtext">Through this whole prototyping and evaluation process, there werenâ€™t many people who got confused of accessing the system compared to the first few iterations which was tested to the member of committee during the internal evaluation.
